# me218b-winter2012
Code for the robot that we built during ME218b at Stanford during the winter of 2012. More details on the project can be found at the [original project website](http://truffleshufflers.weebly.com/).

All code was found in the `.zip` file on the project website. I uploaded it to make it easier to access. The template code was provided by Prof. Ed Carryer and then modified by team members, as indicated at the top of the source files.
